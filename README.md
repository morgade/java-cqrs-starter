# Java study of CQRS based on Edument CQRS Starter Kit

## What is this?

A Java project based on Edument CQRS Tutorial http://cqrs.nu/tutorial/ whose 
original C# sources can be found at 
https://github.com/edumentab/cqrs-starter-kit/

It features the original "tab" domain aggregate, its commands and events 
processors, read projections and event store. It's packaged into a Spring Boot 
Starter Web application with an AngularJS/JSON interface and a few conventional 
support repositories used by its controllers.
